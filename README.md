You need the following in this order:  
Place `OpenGoalTwitchv.exe` and the `.env` file you downloaded inside of a folder next to `gk.exe` and `goalc.exe`  
Modify the contents of `.env` so that it listens for commands in your channel by opening it with notepad making changes and then saving, make sure to save as ALL FILE TYPES If you do not change this it will save it as `.env.txt` and not work. 
Open `OpenGoalTwitchv0.3` and it should automatically open `gk` and `goalc` and connect to twitch, now you are good to go!
