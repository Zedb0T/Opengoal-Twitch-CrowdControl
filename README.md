 # Opengoal-Twitch-CrowdControl  
You need the following in this order:  
Python : https://www.python.org/downloads/ (MAKE SURE TO ADD PYTHON TO PATH OPTION)   
Autohotkey: https://www.autohotkey.com/  
Create a file named `.env` with the same fields as EXAMPLE.env  
Open `buildprogram.bat` and follow the prompts to install the rest of the dependecies and build your twitchintegration program.  
Rename `RENAMEANDPUTNEAROPENGOAL.exe` so you know what channel it listens for commands in  
Place `RENAMEANDPUTNEAROPENGOAL.exe` and the `.env` file you created inside of a folder next to `gk.exe` and `goalc.exe`  
Open Your twitchintegration program and it should automatically open `gk` and `goalc` and connect to twitch, now you are good to go!
